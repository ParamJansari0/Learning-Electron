# Learning-Electron

My progress with learning Electron.

## Video Info

This is an electron app which gives back the video duration of a video. Intended for me to get started with electron and learn Inter Process Communcation with secure practices. As well as explore [electron-reloader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-reloader) for easier testing.

## To-do App

This app is a simple to-do app. Intened for me to explore how to use multiple windows and have them communicate with each other, as well as explore how to make custom menus for each window.

## Tasky App

This app is a simple timer app which only loads on the task bar. Intended for me to explore how Electron works with the Tray, as well as IPC between React and Electron.

## Video Converter App

This app is used to convert video files from one form to another. Intedned for me to explore how Electron works with React and Redux.
